https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/Design_Patterns

Based upon the content at en.wikibooks.org. Alterations:
- code comments
- formatting
- replacing C++98 bits with C++11/14 (e.g. unique_ptr, make_unique)
- bugs (e.g. new without corresponding delete, linked list implementation not setting mHead/mTail properly)
- code simplfications whilst preservig the essence of the design pattern being demonstrated
